        <p>I first began learning to program in May. At first, it was hard to memorize what each function does. But as I practice writing more code, it became easier for me to remeber what to do. I'm still not very good at it, but I want to continue learning. </p>
        <h2 id="second-post">Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>After learning most of the basics of Javascript, I started to start to learn the basics of HTMl and CSS. HTML seems to be easier than javascript.</p>
